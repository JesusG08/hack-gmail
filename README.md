# You need to have python 3 pre-installed
To check your python version, go terminal and search.

    $ python3 --version
    

# In case You Don't Have Python Pre-installed

If you have Ubuntu 16.10 or newer you can easily install python3 using the following commands. 

    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install python3
         
If you are using other Linux distribution, Most probably have Python 3 pre-installed as well. If not, use your
distributionâ€™s package manager. or just read python installing guide.  


    $ sudo dnf install python3


# Recommendations

â€¢ I recommend using Linux distro. (ubuntu,kali,Fedora,Arch,manjaro or etc).

â€¢ I usually recommend you using your own wordlist for Brute-force attract that you customized for the target.
  but always u can use the inbuild password list. feel free to use that list in any type attack. (pwdlist: rockyou.txt) 
  hope this script will help you. Good luck!
